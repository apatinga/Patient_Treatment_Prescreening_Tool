# Patient_Treatment_Prescreening_Tool
The development of this software would assist patients by recommending over the counter (OTC) medications based on the patient’s symptoms. The system would function first, by having a patient input their symptoms. Then the output will return recommended OTC medications based on the entered symptoms or will tell the patient to contact their doctor if symptoms point towards something more serious. The software would function as a prescreening tool for clinics, as well as provide insight on at-home care for patients. From the clinic's standpoint, the software would give healthcare providers information on symptoms a patient is experiencing before the patient even comes into the office. In addition, it would provide insight on whether the patient’s health situation is severe enough to come in for an appointment. If the patient is experiencing mild symptoms, the software will be able to output OTC medication(s) that could be used to treat the patient’s symptoms. If the symptoms are severe enough that the patient should be seen by a doctor, the system will output a message saying the patient should contact their provider.
